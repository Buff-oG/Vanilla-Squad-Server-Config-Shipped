// LAYER_ROTATION: These must be Layer_Id's; those_are_different from_display names! I.e. 'Belaya_AAS_v1' is correct, 'Belaya AAS v1' is not.
// NOTE: this file is used for servers running in MapRotationMode=LayerList, running in order, or for servers running in MapRotationMode=LayerList_Randomized, where the below layers are rotated randomly. This setting can be found in your Server.cfg file (make sure to use a fresh one as your basis).
// NOTE: in-line comments will not work in this config until further notice. Comment lines should be in separate lines, if used.
// NOTE: to select factions played on selected layer use Layer_Id Faction1 Faction2, I.e. 'AlBasrah_AAS_v1 CAF RGF'. Factions should be available on selected layer, also playing with factions from the same alliance is restricted.
